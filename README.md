# git_tasks_praktikum
The script simulating frequent git-push, designed to train trainees in livemaster.ru 

Every two minutes, the "product code" is changed (imitation of adding a new feature). 

The feature == the question the student should answer by making the corresponding changes in the code,
commit and run it in the remote repository.
